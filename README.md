## About This Repository

This repository represents my **Dev Journey**, a structured portfolio of backend development projects and learning progression.  
It highlights my skills in building robust APIs with **Python and Django REST Framework**, designing and testing services with **GoLang**, and applying modern deployment practices including **Docker**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **cloud infrastructure with Terraform and AWS**.

The content here is organized as a series of progressive projects and detailed study plans, each focused on real-world backend development techniques and industry-relevant practices. This documentation is intended to demonstrate professional competency, project organization, and the ability to integrate multiple technologies into scalable solutions.


This repository contains my 7-week study plan for learning and practicing full-stack development, Django REST API, Go, testing, and more.
